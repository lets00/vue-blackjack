# blackjack-vue

A single blackjack-game implemented in Vue to study it. The project is working but I do not recomend to use it in production (I usually use it to learn Vue concepts). There are several design problems. Feel free to submit new PR.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
